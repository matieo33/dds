# dds
REQUIRES IMAGEMAGICK, YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET IT AND DOWNLOAD IT ON YOUR SYSTEM OF CHOICE

Converts any image files from the input folder and converts to dds and outputs it in the output folder. Should work cross-platform (Windows and Linux).

Doesn't use imagemagick libraries, as it uses a simple commands in the terminal, which is why it requires imagemagick downloaded.

File doesn't have any failsafes or error handles, ImageMagick prints out errors (if any).


PS: don't point out the bad code, will fix someday. still could likely improve code performance with multi-threading and switching the way text is printed, but so far it's g


# Installation
## Windows
Download, unzip and run dds.exe, or compile it yourself
## Linux
Download, allow executing file as program in exe's properties, launch in preferred terminal
