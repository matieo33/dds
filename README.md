REQUIRES IMAGEMAGICK, YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO GET IT AND DOWNLOAD IT ON YOUR SYSTEM OF CHOICE

don't point out the bad code, will fix someday

Converts any image files from the input folder and converts to dds and outputs it in the output folder

Doesn't use imagemagick libraries, as it uses a simple commands in the terminal, which is why it requires imagemagick downloaded.

File doesn't have any failsafes or error handles, ImageMagick prints out errors (if any).
